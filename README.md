üìå Analysis 1:  
- **Observation:**
  - Net revenue has shown consistent growth over the years, but **monthly growth rate fluctuations** occur approximately
every two months.
  - **2013 recorded the highest growth rate (28.66%)**, indicating effective business strategies during that period.
  - Return rates are inconsistent and have increased in certain regions, particularly in the **EU and US.**  

- **Recommendation:**
  - **Analyze revenue cycles in detail** to identify key influencing factors (seasonality, promotions, supply chain, customer
behavior, etc.).
  - **Adjust sales strategies based on trends** to reduce volatility.
  - Implement **sales promotions in low-revenue months** to maintain stable growth.
  - Develop **post-peak discount campaigns** to sustain purchasing momentum.

üìå Analysis 2:   
- **Observation:**
  - **APAC is the most promising market,** with strong revenue growth and the lowest return rate.
  - **EU, US, and LATAM have potential** but require better return rate management.
  - **Return rates in the US are gradually increasing,** necessitating closer monitoring and mitigation strategies.
  - **Canada has high order value but low overall revenue,** indicating a willingness to spend among customers.
    
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Expand in APAC** by focusing on high-demand, low-return products.
  - **Refine return policies in the EU and US**, possibly shifting toward product exchanges instead of refunds.
  - Develop new customer acquisition strategies in Canada, leveraging promotional campaigns or local business partnerships.

üìå Analysis 3:  
- **Observation:**
  - Customer count is growing steadily each year, with no significant differentiation across customer segments.
  - Consumers are the primary customer group, but market-specific preferences are unclear.
  - Standard shipping is the most common mode, with little variation across regions.
  - Order value in Canada has consistently increased, despite low overall revenue.
  - On-time delivery rate could impact preferred shipping modes, requiring further analysis.
  
- **Recommendation:**
  - Analyze customer behavior by region to personalize sales strategies.
  - Increase customer acquisition efforts in Canada to raise order volume.
  - Optimize shipping modes by region, possibly experimenting with lower express shipping fees to assess its impact on sales.
  - Enhance on-time delivery rates to improve customer satisfaction and reduce return rates
